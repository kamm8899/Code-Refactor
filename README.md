## Code Refactor for HTML and CSS

# The Repository
This Repository("Code-Refactor") is where I took starter HTML code and did a code refactor on the index.html and style.css file. I updated according best practices for HTML and CSS styles, which include adding an alt tag to img sources, re-usiing CSS code blocks, ensuring following hierachy for headings. 

The Code Refactoring has taught me the best use of other elements within HTML to section of and make the HTML more readable. I changed <div> tags to <main>, <sections> and <article> to break up the readability of the code. 

The Code Refactoring project also solidified my use of the Developer Tool in Chrome to test the code changes before making it on VS Code.

I ran into a few style issues when refactoring the code, as the sections where wrapped by other div tags. The project was based on trial and error to ensure that all element tags where positioned in the right space.
